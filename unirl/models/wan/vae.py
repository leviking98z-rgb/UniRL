"""WANVAEDecodeStage — shared WAN LatentSegment → Videos decoder.

Framework-level ``DecodeStage`` implementation (no REFL-only knobs). Both
GRPO and REFL recipes route their final ``LatentSegment`` through this stage
— the memory / autograd optimizations in ``WanVideoVAE`` (below) are what
make BPTT decode feasible, so pushing this into a recipe would fork the
decode contract across recipes. Kept in the framework.

Implements ``DecodeStage[LatentSegment, Videos]``. Reads the final stored
position from ``LatentSegment.latents[:, -1]`` (the clean latent at
``T``, which ``WAN21DiffusionStage`` always stores), then dispatches to
the bundle's ``WanVideoVAE.decode`` . All un-normalization
(per-channel ``mean`` / ``std``), spatial tiling, nested gradient
checkpointing inside the decoder, and ``Conv3dActGradOnly`` are owned
by ``WanVideoVAE`` itself; this stage is just the
``LatentSegment → Videos`` adapter.

VAE encode for I2V's image-condition latent lives in
``WANImageLatentEncodeStage`` (``image_encode.py``) — it goes through
the same ``WanVideoVAE.encode(x).latent_dist.mode()`` diffusers-style
contract; there is intentionally no generic full-video VAE encode stage.
