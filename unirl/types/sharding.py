"""Token-balanced Sample sharding across equal-size partitions.

Pure-Python helpers for the driver-side seqlen-balancing path (verl
``trainer.balance_batch`` parity): reorder a batch so that, when it is split into
``num_shards`` equal contiguous chunks (the layout ``DP_SCATTER`` produces), each
chunk carries a similar total token count. No torch / framework deps, so the
partition logic is unit-testable in isolation.
