"""Use the flow-match (single-step SDE) scheduler for WAN rollout, not UniPC.

``sglang``'s ``WanPipeline.initialize_pipeline`` hardcodes
``FlowUniPCMultistepScheduler`` (the Wan2.1 official sampler, a multistep ODE
solver). That class does NOT inherit ``SchedulerRLMixin`` — it has no
``_rollout_variance_noise`` / SDE-step log-prob path — so the GRPO rollout
(``rollout=True``, ``rollout_sde_type="sde"``) cannot run on it; the first thing
that breaks is ``set_timesteps`` rejecting the driver's externally pinned σ list
with ``assert isinstance(sigmas, np.ndarray)``.

The other diffusion families (SD3, FLUX, Qwen-Image) all roll out on
``FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler``, which DOES carry the RL mixin and whose
``set_timesteps`` accepts an external σ schedule (coerced to ndarray, with the
shift neutralized by ``patch_set_timesteps`` so the driver-pinned schedule
survives the σ-consistency check). WAN's own DMD pipeline
(``wan_dmd_pipeline.py``) already builds exactly this scheduler the same way, so
swapping is the sanctioned shape for WAN, not a divergence.

This AROUND-wraps ``WanPipeline.initialize_pipeline`` to replace the scheduler
with ``FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler(shift=flow_shift)`` after the stock init
(which only sets the scheduler module). Single-step flow-match transitions also
match what the trainer replays trainside (FlowSDE), keeping GRPO's rollout↔replay
consistency. Idempotent via a sentinel; import-safe (sglang imported inside).
